    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding and Removing Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add cells by going to the ``Insert`` menu and choosing Add above or below. You can also move cells up or down by choosing the upwards or downwards arros located below the insert menu. \n",

    "- To run the whole notebook go to ``Cell->Run all``. If you just want to run the cells above or below you will also find that in the same menu \n",
    "\n",
    "- To re-run the whole notebook, go to ``Kernel -> Restart and Run all`` or press the button that looks like a fastforward button. This clears all variables stored in memory and runs the notebook from scratch. It is important to re-run the notebook from scratch from time to time, for example when you have reached a milestone to make sure that you don't have any bugs. As the notebook stores all the variables in memory, this helps avoid errors due to having deleted something, or have certain elements in the incorrect order within the cells or between cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is important to explain your reasoning in the Markdown cells (see below in section Markdown cells), similarly to the way you would in a report. You can have sections, subsections, write paragraphs, input images and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is also important to comment you code so that any person who opens your notebook understands what you are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When you make use of a library, it is considered good practice to import it at the start of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't forget to save your notebook regularly. You can do this either with the save shortcut (Ctrl+S) or by going through File -> Save as. Under File you will also find other options such as creating a new notebook, renaming the current one, downloading it as a pdf, python file etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Python libraries through the notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of running the installation through the terminal, you can also run the installation from the notebook in a Code cell by calling ``!pip3 install lib1 lib2 lib3``. This is what we will do for the librairies that are required to solve the weekly exercise sessions.\n",
