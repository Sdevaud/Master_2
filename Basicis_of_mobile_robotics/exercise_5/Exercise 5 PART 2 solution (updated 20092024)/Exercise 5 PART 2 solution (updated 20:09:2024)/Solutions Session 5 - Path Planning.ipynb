    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dijkstra’s algorithm is applied like for the grid map, but on this graph. Starting from the start, cell A takes the value $415$ and cell B takes the value $71$. We continue only on cell B. Cell C takes the value $71+154=225$. This is still the lower value. Cell E takes the value $225+192=417$. Now the lower value is in cell A. Cell D takes the value $415+484=899$ or $225+621=846$ depending on which cell you take first (A or C). Cell E has now the smaller value. Cell F takes the value $417+162=579$, and this is still the lower value. The goal is the next cell and the shorter path is SBCEFG.\n",
